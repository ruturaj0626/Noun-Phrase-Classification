## Introduction

Welcome to the Noun Phrase Classification repository! This project is dedicated to developing and implementing a Noun Phrase Classification system for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Noun Phrase Classification involves categorizing noun phrases within text documents into predefined or custom-defined classes or categories. Whether you're working on sentiment analysis, document categorization, or topic modeling, this system provides a foundation for your NLP projects.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Robust data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare text data for classification.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques for extracting relevant features from noun phrases.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks for classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Tools and scripts to evaluate the performance of classification models using common metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Strategies for optimizing model hyperparameters to improve classification accuracy.
- **Cross-Validation:** Techniques for robust model evaluation through cross-validation.
- **Deployment:** Guidance and resources for deploying the trained model for real-world applications.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation explaining the codebase, usage, and best practices.
